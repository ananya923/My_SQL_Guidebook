# My_SQL_Guidebook
This repository contains a guidebook on SQL querying for the IDS706 major assignment. Important notes:

1. Please refer to the file named `my_sql_guidebook.md` to see the guidebook.
2. The repository contains many files with images rendered in the Guidebook. These might seem unorganized, but that is because my machine is facing issues with the terminal and Git Commits. I use windows and have manually set up a Git Bash terminal, but it is not able to sync with cloned GitHub repositories since last week. I'm working with Nick to resolve this issue, since this setup was part of the PDS course. However, in the meantime, I have manually committed my files to GitHub using its **web interface**. Hence, I kept all files in a single directory to avoid further issues.
3. The repo also contains a `.sql` script which I used to connect to the Northwind PostegreSQL database. More details on this setup are included in the Guidebook.
